### Setting
Here is an example of a forest plot containing combined results of risk ratios for a comparison of three exposure groups (high dose, low dose, control, say) from a hypothetical study. These data are in wide format, there is also a version in [long format](ThreeGroupsV1.qmd). Some familiarity with the `forestploter` package is assumed. The reader might want to look at the [simple forest plot](OneSimplePlot.qmd) before continuing.

### Data

This version of the data is in wide format, meaning each exposure group contributes with a set of columns/variables rather than rows/observations.


```{r}
library(forestploter)
library(grid)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)

results <- fread("./data/TwoComparisonFPdatawide.csv")

# point estimates and confidence interval limits for comparisons of groups 1 and 2 against group 0
print(results[,c(1,11:16)], digits = 5)
```

As in the other examples presented at this site, the data needs a bit of editing before it is ready to be plugged into `forest`.

```{r}
round2 <- function(x) format(round(x,digits = 2), nsmall = 2, scientific = FALSE)

results <- results |>
  mutate(
    # events / Number at risk
    en1 = case_when(is.na(events1) ~ "", .default = paste(events1, "/", n1)),
    en2 = case_when(is.na(events2) ~ "", .default = paste(events2, "/", n2)),
    en0 = case_when(is.na(events0) ~ "", .default = paste(events0, "/", n0)),
    
    # text variable with risk ratios
    riskratio1 = case_when(
      is.na(events1) ~ "",
      .default = paste0(round2(rr1), " (", round2(lcl1), " - ", round2(ucl1), ")")),
    riskratio2 = case_when(
      is.na(events2) ~ "",
      .default = paste0(round2(rr2), " (", round2(lcl2), " - ", round2(ucl2), ")")),
    
    # some indentation of some labels
    level = case_when(is.na(events1) | level == "Overall" ~ level, .default = paste(" ", level))
  ) |>
  # since there will be many columns, estimates of absolute risks are suppressed
  select(level, starts_with(c("en", "riskratio", "rr", "lcl", "ucl")))

# empty spaces necessary for the forest function
results$blank <- "                          "
results$smallblank <- " "

# forcing some line breaks in column headers using \n
colnames(results) <- c(
  "Group",
  "Low dose\nEvents / N",
  "High dose\nEvents / N",
  "Comparison\nEvents / N",
  "Low dose vs comparison\nRisk ratio (95% CI)",
  "High dose vs comparison\nRisk ratio (95% CI)",
  "rr1",
  "rr2",
  "lcl1",
  "lcl2",
  "ucl1",
  "ucl2",
  "",
  ""
)

```

In this forest plot we will include the estimates from both comparisons in the same forest plot (see @fig-fpthreevII1).

```{r}
#| label: fig-fpthreevII1
#| fig-cap: |
#|   Forest plot with two sets of results in the same plot

forest(
  results[,c(1,13)],
  est = list(results$rr1, results$rr2),
  lower = list(results$lcl1, results$lcl2),
  upper = list(results$ucl1, results$ucl2),
  ci_column = 2,
  ref_line = 1,
  xlim = c(.5, 1.5),
  ticks_at = c(.5, .75, 1, 1.25, 1.5)
)
```

As always we need to specify all the columns we want, do some specific modifications to some cells, etc.

```{r}
tm <- forest_theme(
  base_size = 15,
  ci_pch = 19,
  ci_lwd = 3,
  
  # a color for each comparison to be used for point estimates and 95% CIs
  ci_col = c("#56B4E9","#001d6d"),
  
  # title in legend - set to missing
  legend_name = "",
  
  # labels to be used for the two comparisons, notice the space included to add some distance between labels
  legend_value = c("Low dose ", "High dose"),
  
  # place the legend below the plot
  legend_position = "bottom",
  refline_gp = gpar(col = "grey"),
  core = list(bg_params = list(fill = c("#e2f0fb", "white")))
)

p <- forest(
  results[,c(1,14,2,14,3,14,4,14,5,14,6,13)],
  est = list(results$rr1, results$rr2),
  lower = list(results$lcl1, results$lcl2),
  upper = list(results$ucl1, results$ucl2),
  ci_column = 12,
  ref_line = 1,
  xlim = c(.5, 1.5),
  ticks_at = c(.5, .75, 1, 1.25, 1.5),
  nudge_y = .25, # increase distance between points within strata
  theme = tm
)


# center aligning columns
p <- edit_plot(
  p,
  col = 3:11,
  part = "header",
  which = "text",
  hjust = unit(.5, "npc"),
  x = unit(.5, "npc")
)

p <- edit_plot(
  p,
  col = 3:11,
  part = "body",
  which = "text",
  hjust = unit(.5, "npc"),
  x = unit(.5, "npc")
)

# bold facing selected cells in first column
p <- edit_plot(
  p,
  col = 1,
  row = c(1, 2, 5, 8, 11),
  part = "body",
  which = "text",
  gp = gpar(fontface = "bold")
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p_wh <- get_wh(plot = p, unit = "in")
ggplot2::ggsave(
  "./figs/fpthreevII2.png",
  p,
  width = p_wh[1] * 1.05,
  height = p_wh[2],
  units = "in"
)
```
